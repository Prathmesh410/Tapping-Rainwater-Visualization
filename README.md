This is a simple webpage that allows users to enter an array of heights and calculates the amount of water that would be trapped between the heights. It does this by applying two algorithms, calculateTotalWater and trappingWater, to the input array. The result is then displayed on the page, along with blocks representing the heights and the amount of water trapped between the blocks. The webpage consists of an HTML file (index.html), a CSS file (styles1.css), and a JavaScript file (script1.js). The HTML file defines the structure of the webpage, while the CSS file is used to style the HTML elements. The JavaScript file contains the logic of the program, including the event listeners, the algorithm functions, and the functions that generate the blocks and the water.
